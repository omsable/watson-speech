      speakerLabels:
        help: If true, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting speaker_labels to true forces the timestamps parameter to be true, regardless of whether you specify false for the parameter.

      profanityFilter:
        help: If true, the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to false to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only.
        type: boolean
        required: false

      smartFormatting:
        help: "If true, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart formatting. Note: Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only."
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: true

      timestamps:
        help: If true, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned.
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: false
        in: requestBody
      audioMetrics:
        help: If true, requests detailed information about the signal characteristics of the input audio. The service returns audio metrics with the final transcription results. By default, the service returns no audio metrics.
        type: boolean
        required: false
        default: false
        in: requestBody
      redaction:
        help:
          "If true, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an X character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the service performs no redaction.

          When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the keywords and keywords_threshold parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the max_alternatives parameter to be 1).

          Note: Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only."
